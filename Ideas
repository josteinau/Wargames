Write dead units to file

Get total health, armor and hitpoints from army

Get odds pre-battle based on hp, hitpoints etc

Commander Aura - if commander getName equals
ranged aura, 10% increase ranged units
Damage increase by 10%

 generateRandomName(String randomName){
    if(orc){
    array[randomOrcNames]
    if(human){
    array[otherRandomNames]
    return randomName

Reduce armor for each hit, armor gets more and more broken. If not the commander-units are OP!
